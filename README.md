### Setup

- Fork, Clone, npm install, npm start
- Slight quirk - refreshing doesn't work from any path other than the default one so you will have to go back to the default path to refresh

### App.tsx

- Import BrowserRouter,Switch and Route from react-router-dom
- Import components needed
- Create the appropriate routes `{/* PUT YOUR ROUTES HERE */}`
- Make sure the default route goes at the bottom
- Make sure BrowserRouter wraps everything
- Make sure you use the component prop, not render.

### Routes

- /page-1 -> Page 1
- /page-2 -> Page 2
- / -> Dashboard

### Existing components

- LeftPart.tsx
  - Left form part of Content 1
- RightPart.tsx
  - Right Message part of Content 1
- Content2.tsx
  - Some buttons
